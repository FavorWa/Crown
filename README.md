# Crown
HUBXC 475 Crown Project

This repo holds the code for Crown: a mobile app made for people with textured hair.

Crown provides an escape from the trial-and-error period that most people go through. Users can select filters that refine their search to products, routines, and hairstylists that best fit them. In addition, they can join groups to find a community and read reviews on hairstylists.

To install Crown, you will have to install Python (which includes pip/pip3) and node/nvm.

Since we are using VSCode, here is a guide to installing Python on VSCode for both Windows
and MacOS: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial.

To install node and nvm, run 'npm install -g npm'.

1. Change directories to the backend folder. To install the dependencies, run 'pip install requirements.txt' if you're Windows. If you're on Mac, run 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt'.

2. Change directories to the frontend folder, and then run 'npm install'.

Here are some mockups of our app: https://readymag.com/anitaemokpae/4201898/3/
